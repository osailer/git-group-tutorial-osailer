# git-group-tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to learn and apply git commands needed to collaborate on a team project.

# GitHub Basics: Command-Line Workflow

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Familiarize students with essential GitHub operations and group collaboration workflows using GitHub. Topics covered include:

- Forking
- Cloning
- Branching
- Committing
- Resolving conflicts
- Pull requests
- Merging
- Deploying via GitHub Pages

This guide focuses on using GitHub via **Windows/Unix command-line tools** rather than the GitHub Desktop app. While the command line is more efficient, it can be less beginner-friendly â€” this document aims to bridge that gap.
